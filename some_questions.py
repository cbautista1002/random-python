# 1. What are decorators? When are they evaluated by the python interpreter?

# 2. What are list comprehensions, generators, and generator comprehensions?

# 3. If you have a generator object and two functions want to use this object (to
#    get data from it), do you foresee any issues? Anything to look out for?

# 4. If you have a list of strings, how would you find the occurrence of each
#    string without using list.count()?

# 5. Dictionaries do not maintain order for you. How would you implement this feature?

# 6. How do you create an object of a class without calling its
#    constructor (without __init__ being called)?

# 7. Given the following table structure, write an SQL query that finds the departments
#    which had average sales > 50 in April:
#    department, salesperson, sale ($), month
